## Part 1 – Core Git Concepts

**What is version control, and why is it essential in software development?**

- Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so we can track history of the files, compare versions, and revert to earlier states.
- It’s essential in software development because it prevents data loss, supports collaboration, and helps manage project evolution.

**What kind of problems does version control solve (e.g., tracking changes, backups, rollbacks)?**

- Tracking changes: Know who changed what and when.
- Backups: Code history is safely stored.
- Rollbacks: Easily revert to a stable version if something breaks.

**What is Git and why do developers use it?**

Git is a distributed version control system that lets developers track and manage changes in source code. Developers use it because it’s fast, works offline, supports branching, and has powerful merging features.

**What is GitHub and how is it different from Git?**

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.

- Git: The tool for version control (installed on the computer).
- GitHub: A platform to store, share, and collaborate on Git repositories online.

**What are the benefits of using version control in solo and team projects?**

- Solo: Safeguards code, allows rollback, organizes project history.
- Team: Enables parallel work, avoids conflicts, ensures accountability, supports code review.

**What is a remote repository?**

A remote repository is a version of the project hosted online or on another server, used for sharing and syncing code with others.

**What is a branch?**

A branch is a separate line of development that lets us work on features or fixes without affecting the main project until changes are ready to merge.

**Why do developers create feature branches instead of committing directly to main?**

Developers create feature branches instead of committing directly to the main (or master) branch to maintain stability, facilitate collaboration, and enable better code review processes.

**What is a pull request and why is it used in collaborative development?**

A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another. It’s used for code review, discussion, and approval before merging to ensure quality and prevent bugs.
